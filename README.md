# The analysis

Each query for this project aimed of investigating specific aspects 0f the data analyst job market. Here's how I approached each question: 

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Job

To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average rearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. this query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
WITH remote_data_anayst_top_jobs as 
( 
    SELECT 
        job_id,
        company_id,
        job_title,
        job_location,
        job_schedule_type,
        salary_year_avg,
        job_posted_date

    FROM 
        job_postings_fact
    WHERE job_title_short='Data Analyst' 
        and job_location='Anywhere' 
        and salary_year_avg is not null

    order by salary_year_avg desc
    limit 1000
)

select cd.name, 
       rdatj.job_title, 
       rdatj.job_location, 
       rdatj.job_schedule_type,
       rdatj.salary_year_avg,
       rdatj.job_posted_date
from remote_data_anayst_top_jobs rdatj join company_dim cd
