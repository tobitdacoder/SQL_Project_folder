So, if you're ready to embark on a journey toward career success, dive into our project, and navigate with us into the dynamic landscape of data analysis jobs. 

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL query were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. what skills are required the most for the top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. what are the most optimal skills to learn ?
 
# Tools I Used

For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnesed the power of several key tools: 

- **SQL**: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL**: The chosen database management system (D.B.M.S), ideal for handling the HUGE job posting database.
- **Visual Studio Code**: My go-to code editor for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub**: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The analysis

Each query for this project aimed of investigating specific aspects 0f the data analyst job market. Here's how I approached each question: 

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Job

To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average rearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. this query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
WITH remote_data_anayst_top_jobs as 
( 
    SELECT 
        job_id,
        company_id,
        job_title,
        job_location,
        job_schedule_type,
        salary_year_avg,
        job_posted_date

    FROM 
        job_postings_fact
    WHERE job_title_short='Data Analyst' 
        and job_location='Anywhere' 
        and salary_year_avg is not null

    order by salary_year_avg desc
    limit 1000
)

select cd.name, 
       rdatj.job_title, 
       rdatj.job_location, 
       rdatj.job_schedule_type,
       rdatj.salary_year_avg,
       rdatj.job_posted_date
from remote_data_anayst_top_jobs rdatj join company_dim cd
on rdatj.company_id = cd.company_id;
```

Based on the result of this query, here is the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:

- **Wide Salary Range:** Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from **$184,000 to $650,000**; indicating significant salary potential in the field of data analytics. 

- **Diverse Employers:** Big companies like **SmartAsset, Meta, and AT&T** are among those offering high salaries, showing a broad interest accross different industries.

- **Job Title Variety:** There is a high diversity in job titles, from Data Analysts to Director of analytics, reflecting varied roles and specializations within the field of Data Analytics.

### 2. Skills For Top Paying Jobs.

To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers values for high-compensation data analysis related roles.

```sql
/*
-- Now am creating a table that will store all the columns and reccords generated by the CTE that we created in the previous query.

this is to help us structure that data generated by the CTE in one single table and be able to use that data in other queries later.
*/
create table top_data_analyst_remote_jobs_postings as 

(

    WITH remote_data_anayst_top_jobs as 
    ( 
            SELECT 
                job_id,
                company_id,
                job_title,
                job_location,
                job_schedule_type,
                salary_year_avg,
                job_posted_date

            FROM 
                job_postings_fact
            WHERE job_title_short='Data Analyst' 
                and job_location='Anywhere' 
                and salary_year_avg is not null

            order by salary_year_avg desc
            limit 10
        )
        select cd.name,
            rdatj.job_id, 
            rdatj.job_title, 
            rdatj.job_location, 
            rdatj.job_schedule_type,
            rdatj.salary_year_avg,
            rdatj.job_posted_date
        from remote_data_anayst_top_jobs rdatj join company_dim cd
        on rdatj.company_id = cd.company_id

/*
Now let us JOIN the tables that will allow us to get the skill names that are needed for each of these top data anamysis jobs that we've recently fetched from the database.

NOTE: tdarj = top_data_analyst_remote_jobs_postings (the table we have just created from that complex query from the previous query file 1)
*/

SELECT tdarj.name as company_name, tdarj.job_title, sjd.job_id,tdarj.salary_year_avg, sd.skills
FROM top_data_analyst_remote_jobs_postings tdarj JOIN skills_job_dim sjd
     ON tdarj.job_id = sjd.job_id
     JOIN skills_dim sd ON sjd.skill_id = sd.skill_id
     ORDER BY tdarj.salary_year_avg desc;
);
```
Here is the breakdown of the mot demanded skills for the top 10 highest paying data analyst jobs in 2023:

- **SQL** is leading with a bold count of 8, which is the amiunt of times it is repeated among the skills to aquire.
- **Python** follows closely with a count of 7, the number of times it is repeated as one of the skills to aquire.
- **Tableau**, the most used visualization tool, is also highly sought after, with a bold count of 6. Other skills like **R, Snowflake, Pandas** and **Excel** show varying but important degrees of demand too.

### 3. In-demand Skills for data analysts

This query helped in identifying the skills that are most frequently requested in jppb postings, directing focus to areas with high demand.

```sql
SELECT sd.skills, count(sjd.skill_id) as skill_demand_count
FROM job_postings_fact jpf JOIN skills_job_dim sjd 
     ON jpf.job_id = sjd.job_id
     JOIN skills_dim sd ON sjd.skill_id=sd.skill_id
WHERE jpf.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' and jpf.job_work_from_home=true
GROUP BY sd.skills 
ORDER BY skill_demand_count desc
limit 5;

/*
this query is the one that allows us to know what are the top 5 in demand 
skills for Data analysts especially, who also can worj from home. this is 
to show what skill to focus on when we want to apply to a Data Analyst job
with the remote work option.
*/
```
Here is a breackdown of the most demanded skills for data analysts in 2023

- **SQL** and **EXCEL** remain fundamental, emphasizing the need for strong foundational skills in data cleaning, processing and data manipulation. 

- **Programming** and **Visualization Tools** like **Python, Tableau** and **Power BI** are essential, pointing towards the increasing importance of technical skills in data storytelling and decision support.

### 4. Skills Based on Salary

Exploring the average salary associated with different skills revealed which skills are the highest paying.

```sql
SELECT sd.skills, ROUND(AVG(jpf.salary_year_avg),2) as averare_salary_per_skill
FROM job_postings_fact jpf JOIN skills_job_dim sjd 
     ON jpf.job_id = sjd.job_id
     JOIN skills_dim sd ON sjd.skill_id=sd.skill_id
WHERE jpf.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' and jpf.salary_year_avg is not NULL 
      AND jpf.job_work_from_home=true 
GROUP BY sd.skills 
ORDER BY averare_salary_per_skill desc
limit 25;
```
